									Week-5 Report

Last   we did the user authentication and validated in Local terminal via Node.js. Initially, installed all the required packages like  bcrypt, mysql, jsonwebtokens. Secondly, running XAMPP( Apache server and SQL).

 Last week we created when a user successfully logs in, a dashboard screen stating "welcome,Bhanu moukthika!" is displayed. Next, we developed buttons for user profiles, fitness videos, workout plans, and diet plans on a navigation bar we called Menu.Prior to evaluating every button, we collect user data such as gender, age, height, and asking about their goals: Weight gain or Weight loss. So, when a user fills all these attributes and depending on his goal, the plan gets started. Therefore, he/she can view the goal related workout videos and diet plans and also workout plans too. But, this week only user can see the form and fill their details, In coming week, all other buttons and funtionalities will work.

This week we developed the "get started" buttons to allow users to enter details like age, height, weight etc. When the user starts their profile accordinglyÂ with the the preferences, they may see their results, including their BMI, BMR, and daily calorie count for maintenance and motivation.The user can  view the available diet, exercise, and fitness schedules. In order to make it easy for users to browse similar videos, we built functionalities for diet programs, work schedules, and fitness videos.Our workouts included arm, chest, back, and abs. There are directly linked to YouTube videos within each one.As instance, users don't need to start over every time they log in because their data is automatically kept and their plans and profile are started.
 
 
 Note: I have attached a successful snapshot.

 
 Note: If you want to run the above process and validate , download node.js and download "XAMPP" and run MySQL and Apache. Then in your visual studio code terminal follow the "packages-installed.txt" and give command  "npm start". Then you get a port number. So, you get port number as 5000. Then type  "localhost:5001" in your brower and then signup. You see the results.
